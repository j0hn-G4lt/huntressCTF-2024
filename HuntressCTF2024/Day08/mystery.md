## Mystery

Enigma machines are an infamous Nazi cryptography tool that was very sophisticated and assumed uncrackable at the time. Now you can learn to program one in notepad, how times have changed. Anyways, even if you don't know how to do that, there are [tools](https://dmgs.dk/cryptii/) simulating them. Given the parameters to properly decode, set them on your enigma and feed the ciphertext. Should get something like this

`messa gewra ppedi nligh thidd endee perou tofsi ghtlo cking itmor etigh tanyw ayyou rflag isher eflag fdfea bcacb ebfba daefb eccaa dddba fezzz`

Clean up the spacing and your flag is: `flag{fdfeabcacbebfbadaefbeccaadddbafe}`
