## Hidden Streams
Another .evtx challenge, this one involving Sysmon logs. Can sort and search for suspicious Event ID's associated with malicious activity.

Eventually you will find Event ID 15 â€” **File Create Stream Hash**, containing a powershell.exe execution with contents `ZmxhZ3tiZmVmYjg5MTE4MzAzMmY0NGZhOTNkMGM3YmQ0MGRhOX0=`. Decode this as base64 and obtain the flag.
`flag{bfefb891183032f44fa93d0c7bd40da9}`
