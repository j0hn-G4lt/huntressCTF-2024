## The Void

Once you start this challenge it will quickly overrun your screen with blank data. After solving by button mashing I figured out what actually happened. If press keys it will drift off up the terminal, so we are definitely receiving data continuously. If you CTRL+F or search for `flag{` you will find many many results. Strange. I accidentally did it, but what you are to do is copy paste a chunk of this into something and you will see lots of spaces and the flag printed clear as day.
`flag{b1370ac4fadd8c0237f8771d7d77286a}`
